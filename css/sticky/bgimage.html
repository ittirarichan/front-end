    <h6>A background image can really set the tone for a design or website. It’s often used to complement the content in a way that enhances the overall aesthetic without overpowering it. A well-chosen background image can provide context, create mood, and add visual interest. It’s important to consider aspects like contrast, resolution, and how the image aligns with the content to ensure it supports rather than distracts from the message you’re trying to convey.</h6>
